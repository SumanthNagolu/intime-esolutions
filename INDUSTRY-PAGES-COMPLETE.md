## **RECOMMENDATION:**

Given the scope, I suggest:

**OPTION A: Complete Top 5 Now** (2-3 hours)
- Financial Services
- Engineering  
- Legal
- Logistics
- Accounting

Then deploy, enhance others iteratively.

**OPTION B: Batch Complete All 13** (8 hours)
- I'll work through all systematically
- You review periodically
- Deploy when all complete

**OPTION C: AI-Assisted Batch** (1 hour)
- I'll create templates with placeholders
- Use GPT-4 to generate industry-specific content
- I'll review and refine
- Much faster, still high quality

Which approach do you prefer? Or should I just start cranking through them one by one?
