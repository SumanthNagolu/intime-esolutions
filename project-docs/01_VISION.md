## UNSTUCTURED##
Here is what I am trying to do.. I am a guidewire trainer who trains people on gudiwre and my speciality is the process i create dfor it. 

For training, 
1. I broke the entire Guidewire cc, pc, and bc in to 250 topics that we can go in sequential order. And the magic is that we start from functional perspective of the tools with introductions to all centers then go in to confugurations starting from commn, cc, pc abd bc. Then get on to integrations and certifications. 
2. Each topic has its own structure, a self study lesson with slides and notes, foloowed by a screen recorded demo en of the toipc covered where i explained each step iof implementing it explaining while doing it with a real user story. and at the end give a quiz and assignment exactly replicating the demo with a different example. Once they sumit, i provide a solutions document with ultra detailed clear step. by step implementaion stpes for usser story in assignment and answers. Idea is to explain, show,  test/check and make them repeat, so it gets ingrained in them, they get exposure to 2 different live implentations of every single topic. And teh cherry on teh cake teh assignemnts are sequential and build on each other. So the curriculam is designed in a way that every topic is covered hands on and in turn implementing entire GW solo in a small scale. 
3. I spend time with each, build candiadate profile on day 0, and assign each candidate a persona with a resume, and a detailed profile project attached. So the resume lets say they are 10 yesr experienced, then their challenfe for teh profile is to aquire equal understanding as teh assumed profile. To assist the we provide a resuem of assumed persona, and depending on teh project experiencce in teh resume, i provide a profile project template which over the course of training will gets transformed to holistic bilbe for teh candidaet that they carry for their life to keep enhancing and companion proffesional journal.. So it starts with the assumed persona background, introduction well written exactly how an ace guy do in live interview, followed by each individual project. And in each project we follow a perfect structure where covers project etails like client, project, what team was doing, size, our role, team process, our process, daily, weekly, spirnt, delivery outine and about 7 -11 user storys given as a project for candidate to finish. I pick these user stories straight from teh resume i provided them. To assist candidate to achieve the challenge. 
4. My jobs is to orchestrate every thing, like making sure all certification questions and interview needed skills are ingrained in training. In parallel i connect with them one-to-one twice a week to go over the questions they have, set a direction and agenda, give them real world perspective, prepare them for interview and acting as a coach to finish thei project, clear their certification and interviews. 
5. For Interviews, I use a specifc method sticking to my core principe, of explai, show and make them repeat to the core. I mimic teh live interview, and as my assitant to act as a interviewr asking questions, candiadet taking inteview as applicant of a job. The simple addition i did is Candidate while on call shares his screenw ith system audio so i can hear the questions, uses 2 diffeent headphoes in 2 yeas one lsiteting to questions and one connected to my screen share call so he can hear answers real time and repeat. Idea is not just to teach ansers but also teh way , tone, style evrything.. making them interview proof for life. 

 Now I am trying make use of AI and all teh modern tools to build applicatio(s) as an extention of me and scale. For example I can train few expeireced reosuces to my pocess and offer the training at scale or make a bot and integrate it . Build a training curriclam ina more modern way replacing PPTS with vedios.. may be one video attached to eveey lesson generated usin g PPT and demo together for each topic, attach/integrate a bot to answer any question real time. Create profile templpate in mass by hiring resouces and using bot to sysnthesize and keep geenrating new ones suited to market needs. Bot also running teh mentor/coordinator/assistant .. also taking care of interview prep.. in 2 modes, one auto mode where bot itself is teh interviewers and assitannt where candiadet os appicacant  in between or teh other, we havea real person asking real questions in true keeping it humane and candidate using bod to practice asnwer/repeat ansewrs real time. So it should be an expetntion mine by personalized to candidsate profile.. may be uploaad profile or integrate profiel also in teh taining appliation where  once candidate has profiel in our system they can use it for wver as subscription. (amy be we can try a side product we can sell for different roles in future)


In short replace me with. AI version of curretn me which can leearn and enhance itself way better and faster than me going forward, Plan is o hire coordinators train them on process and i bcoem a show man running the show.

So, I gave why and when is now now .. I want AI to plan what and how part. Ho amany applications? 1 0r many.. Design, architectur, plan, execution, code, test, everyting delegated to AI.. I am acting as torch bearer,  a true CEO. 



Assuem you are CEO of Claude . All i have is idea and i want it get it out woth spending a crazy amont of time and money.. may be 2000 dollards for building in tools/tech stack charges. And should be out in 20-30 hours of my own work. We can keep perfecting it for ever from then on. HI want you to guide me on how do i make Cursor do it? what should i say it? hiw shoud i sy it? Give me teh exact starter promt. also tips to talk to it later. I want to use cursor as my primary to do all plan, and dev work. I have cursor ai, supabase, chatgpt pro, claude max, github, already and can change/get new ones as suggested.

# My Vision - Raw and Unfiltered

*This is why I'm building this. Every conversation starts here.*

## Who I Am
I'm a Guidewire trainer who has cracked the code on making people job-ready. Not just certified - but actually capable of walking into any Guidewire project and delivering value from day one.

## The Problem I Solve
People get Guidewire certifications but can't pass interviews. They have knowledge but no hands-on experience. They can answer questions but can't implement solutions. I fix this.

## My Current Reality
- I train people 1-on-1 with my proven 250-topic methodology
- Each student becomes a crafted professional with assumed experience
- I literally sit with them during practice interviews, feeding answers real-time
- My students don't just pass interviews - they ACE them
- But I can only handle 10-15 students at a time
- I'm the bottleneck to my own success

## My Dream (Why This Platform)
Imagine if my brain, my process, my experience could be replicated infinitely:
- 1,000 students learning simultaneously
- AI mentors that think like me available 24/7
- Interview prep that doesn't need me on the call
- Profile generation that crafts perfect candidates
- All my knowledge, none of my time limits

## The Business Vision
- Start: $99/month subscription for full access
- Scale: 1,000 students = $99,000/month
- Expand: Add more products beyond Guidewire
- Ultimate: Become THE platform for insurance tech training

## My Non-Negotiables
1. Quality cannot drop - AI must maintain my standards
2. Students must get RESULTS - jobs, not just certificates
3. The personal touch must remain - even if it's AI-delivered
4. Sequential learning is KEY - no skipping ahead
5. Hands-on practice is MANDATORY - theory alone fails

## Why Now?
- AI is finally good enough to replicate my teaching style
- Cursor can build what would have taken a team of 10
- Guidewire demand is exploding globally
- Remote work makes online training the norm
- I'm ready to scale beyond trading time for money

## Success Metrics
- Student gets a job = SUCCESS
- Student passes certification = PROGRESS
- Student completes 250 topics = COMMITMENT
- Everything else is vanity

## My Role Going Forward
- I become the conductor, not the orchestra
- I improve the system, not deliver the training
- I create new content, not repeat the same lessons
- I scale impact, not hours worked

This platform is my legacy. It's how my methodology lives beyond me.
