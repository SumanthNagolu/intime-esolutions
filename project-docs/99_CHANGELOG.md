## Session 005 - December 2, 2025 (Sprint 3 Wrap Review)

### 🎯 Sprint Goal
Evaluate Sprint 3 outputs (ClaimCenter content expansion + onboarding improvements) and verify readiness for learner activation targets.

### ⚠️ Findings
- ❌ **Content ingestion tooling absent** – No new scripts or services exist to batch-insert topics; `modules/topics/` still only exports read/update queries.
- ❌ **ClaimCenter topics not seeded** – Database has no additional topics; platform cannot deliver the promised 50-topic curriculum.
- ⚠️ **Onboarding untouched** – `dashboard` and `TopicContent` UIs lack guided checklists, persona reminders, or contextual tips.
- ⚠️ **Reminder workflow missing** – No Supabase tables/functions for opt-in email nudges; schema unchanged.
- ⚠️ **Activation metrics missing** – Dashboard still surfaces only aggregate counts, no time-to-first-completion instrumentation.

### ✅ Notable Updates
- `project-docs/SPRINT_2_RUNBOOK.md` now uses snake_case JSON in seeding examples and calls out ingestion workflow steps.

### 🚧 Required Actions (carry into Sprint 4 readiness)
1. Ship ingestion tooling (CLI or admin UI) that validates snake_case payloads and logs imports.
2. Seed first 50 ClaimCenter topics and QA sequential locks in staging.
3. Implement onboarding enhancements (guided checklist, persona tips) and analytics for activation KPIs.
4. Build stalled-learner reminder job with opt-in storage and RLS policies.
5. Update `project-docs/06_CURRENT_SPRINT.md` to close Sprint 3 and prepare Sprint 4 backlog once deliverables land.

### 🔗 Vision Alignment
Sprint 3 outputs do not yet advance the jobs-first mission; without content and onboarding improvements, learners cannot progress toward hiring outcomes.
